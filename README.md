# Uber Data Analysis and Visualization

The Uber data analysis and visualization project aims to understand the patterns and trends in Uber rides, focusing on different time dimensions such as hours, days, and months. This analysis can provide insights into peak usage times, the distribution of rides across different periods, and overall trends in Uber service utilization. Such insights are valuable for improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer experience, and optimizing resource allocation.

## Data Overview
The dataset used in this project typically includes information on Uber rides such as:
Date and Time: Timestamp of the ride.
Hour: Hour of the day when the ride was taken.
Day of the Week: Day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
Month: Month in which the ride was taken.
Total Rides: The number of rides.

## Objectives
Hourly Analysis: Determine the distribution of Uber rides across different hours of the day.
Daily Analysis: Understand how ride distribution varies by day of the week.
Monthly Analysis: Identify trends in ride distribution across different months.
Combined Analysis: Visualize how hourly patterns change across different months.

## Methodology
Data Cleaning: Ensure that the dataset is free from missing values and inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Extract necessary time-based features such as hour, day of the week, and month from the timestamp.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate summary statistics and initial plots to understand the data.
Visualization: Create detailed plots to visualize the distribution of rides across different time dimensions.
